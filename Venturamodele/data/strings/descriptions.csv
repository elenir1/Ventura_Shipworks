ele_atlasventura,SHIP,"Mod author note: The Atlas Ventura is a legacy ship, meant only as a reminder that we all start somewhere. Refer to the Rustyard for the reworked version


One of the first ships constructed after the Ventura rebellion, multiple salvage yard raids were needed just to construct a single ship. The Atlas Ventura class is one of the smaller but bulkier capital classes in the sector, featuring strong broadside capabilities and a sizeable flight deck, ships of this class became the anchor point of many Venturan fleets.

The effectiveness of this class in entirely dependant on the ability of its captain. Thanks to its massive blind spot, many ships of this class are outmanouvered and gunned down. However, stories of ship's shields and armour being torn apart by its immense firepower before being tactically striked by this class's strike craft are not unheard of, and the names of the sailors who performed these manoeuvres became sour reminders in the memory of many factions in the sector.",,,
ele_auroraventura,SHIP,"The Venturan fleet had multiple encounters with Try-Tachyon navy. The ship graveyards produced by these encounters were the primary source for various Venturan engineers to reclaim and improvise on new ship designs. Starting out as an Aurora class cruiser, the half destroyed ships were re-welded and reshaped into what was called the litter class. Lacking in armour and extremely fragile, its only saving grace being the absurd amount of firepower this ship carries.

Functioning as a capital ship hunter, Litter class captains have to always stay alert, for a single torpedo to its hull could spell disaster. The litter is fitted with a quite advanced missile fabrication system, allowing it to pressure and then exploit holes in the enemy defences. With proper manoeuvring and aim, the sheer volume of torpedos and missiles this class can bring can tear apart even the strongest ships in the sector.",,,
ele_trashdogventura,SHIP,"Originally built as a mistake after corrupted ""blueprints"" got shared around the Venturan shipyards. The trashdog class is the worst of the worst in terms of ships, using ripped out parts from other ships. Most trashdog class ships are incapable of even achieving proper conditions for space travel. That, however, meant that the trashdog was an excellent way to maintain crew and fleet morale. Unruly navy men and captains would get assigned a role inside the trashdog, from there, their average lifespan was calculated to be around a few days. After implementing these policies, unruly behaviour cases went down by 50% in the Venturan fleets!",,,
ele_goliathventura,SHIP,"The Goliath marks the start of a new era in Venturan ship making. Using proper building techniques, the Goliath class was built to supply strike craft and fighters en masse for the Venturan fleets. The rising faction slowly gained the reputation for carrier heavy fleets, and the Goliath hull was a mayor contribution. Using spare parts from the Buffalo hull alongside with crafty welding, the Goliath was a cost effective way to provide pressure against enemy fleets.

While slow and under armed, the Goliath is a trusty ship, durable and with the ability to deploy a great number of strike craft, the Goliath has little to worry about flanking frigates. This makes the Goliath a great support carrier that can survive without a dedicated escort. 

Although this hull is designed to stay out of combat, a few crazed captains have indeed attemped to use its massive weight as a battering ram. Results from this manouver vary greatly.",,,
ele_pathergoliathventura,SHIP,"Some of the most extremist and crazed Venturan engineers turned their eyes towards more radical ideals. As such, these crazed lunatics joined the Luddic Path in an effort to destroy the Try-Tachyon and everything related to it.

The Goliath's heavy armour and bulk made it a pristine target for the Path's modifications. Carrier decks were replaced with improperly welded missile mounts, alongside with additional armour plates being added to the ship, such modifications gave rise to the Goliath Mk II.

While still focused on serving a carrier role, the Goliath Mk II is much more centered on being in the frontline, unwise captains will be caught off-guard by the amount of firepower this hull can bring, while at the same time, being capable of handling quite a bit of punishment itself.",,,
ele_Arsenalventura,SHIP,"The Arsenal was one of the last project by Venturan engineers. Being not much more than a glorified fighter factory with engines strapped to it. The Arsenal became notorious for its exotic shaped layout and the sheer amount of fighters it could bring to the table. Originally built to challenge the Astral, legendary stories are told when fleets of these carriers met on the battlefields of the Sector.

Very few Arsenal remain, but the few that do prove to be mighty opponents. While the ship lacks armament, it more than makes up with the size of its flight deck. Most Arsenal captains sit behind a competent screen of frigates, sending swarm upon swarm of fighter craft towards their opponents, eventually, even the biggest of capital ships will fall for what is best described as a death by a thousand cuts.",,,
ele_rumdeckventura,SHIP,"The Rumdeck is the ship that you need when some scallywags refuse to give you the hard earned loot that you deserve. Fitted with the best of the best in Pirate firepower, who cares if this was supposed to be a carrier, we'll armed it to the teeth.

Traders know to fear a Rumdeck, for its guns are many, and its fighters are plenty. The good ol' smell of gunpowder and destroyed ships will hit your nose as you claim credits and gold until there is no more.",,,
ele_Ludapostle,SHIP,"As Ludd's chosen strike down the forces of evil, the corpses of their capital ships are taken in by the Path's shipyards. Holes left over by Hammer torpedos are used as weapon placements, scars that are a result of suicidal charges performed by the Path's captains are welded together or turned into Fighter docks. Once the enemy of Ludd, the ship is brought back to life, this time, as a weapon of truth, a hammer to destroy evil. 

Apostle captains constantly seek to prove their worth in the eyes of Ludd, a sort of redemption act for the ship's previous sins. Often charging head on against the enemy. The Apostle class presents impressive speed and manoeuvrability for a capital ship, but at the same time, its defensive components are minimal if non existent, makeshift shields and weapon placements make the Apostle quite a vulnerable ship. This, however, does little to deter its fanatical crew from going on almost suicidal charges, all in the name of Ludd.",,,
ele_divinefire,SHIP,"Once a medium cargo hauler. The Ludd's Fire class is a suicidal and reckless attempt at crafting a weapon from the very easily found Buffalo. Anything non vital is torn out from the ship, and cargo holds were converted to missile racks.

Extremely cost effective and unreliable, the Ludd's Fire hull serves little more as a platform to deliver a constant barrage of hammer torpedos at the enemy, the ship sports additional thrusters that allow it to easily get into torpedo range. Its ammunition supplies are plentiful, and rarely does a this hull survive to the point where it can spend them all.

",,,
ele_Omicron,SHIP,"The Omicron serves as a cheap (For a high tech ship) carrier than can bring strike craft and fighter pressure into engagements. A favourite of low ranking Tri-Tachyon officials, the Omicron class managed to spread around the sector as reliable ship and one of the few carrier-frigates.

The ship's main feature is its quite large fighter manufactury, allowing it to field a higher than standard amount of craft per wing. The Omicron also features an advanced shielding system that wouldn't look out of place in more expensive and larger crafts. While the hull lacks weapon mounts, in an emergency situation, it can still brawl with and even beat other frigate sized hulls.",,,
ele_Rustyard,SHIP,"The Rustyard was one of the first ventures into ship building by the Venturans, meant as a cheap but reliable jack of all traits, the Rustyard was supplied with plenty of firepower and fighter capability, at the cost of an awkward weapon layout. Highly adaptable, the Rustyard brings both long range firepower and close range brawling into the battlefield. However, due to the weapon layout, the Rustyard is extremely weak in 1vs2 situations, and requires competent support so its massive blind spot is not exploited.


Stories of the Rustyard depict both facets of the ship. Unskilled captains getting flanked and losing their ship against frigates all the way to Rustyard captains overwhelming the defence of stronger ships like the Conquest or Onslaught.",,,
ele_flakbus,SHIP,"Built to support the Venturan Arsenal hull, the FlakBus anti-fighter platform is a quite competent destroyer sized ship, especially for the extremely shoddy methods employed in building it. Although the area covered by the Flakbus' weapon and flare systems is small, anything that gets near it, be it a missile or fighter, is almost guaranteed to be obliterated by the sheer amount of flak this ship can bring. The success of the hull meant it was mass produced by the Venturans and eventually the design spread to other factions.

Used mostly as a capital ship escort, this hull serves as a thorn in the back of enemy fighter squadrons. However, in smaller fleets, the Flakbus is sometimes used as an emergency frontline destroyer, such formations are often regarded as desperate and foolish.",,,
